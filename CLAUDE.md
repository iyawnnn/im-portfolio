# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project overview

Personal portfolio site for Ian Macabulos, built with Next.js 15 (App Router), TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. Package manager is **pnpm** (see `pnpm-workspace.yaml` / `pnpm-lock.yaml` — do not use npm/yarn).

## Commands

```bash
pnpm dev      # start dev server (next dev)
pnpm build    # production build (next build)
pnpm start    # run production build
pnpm lint     # eslint
```

There is no test suite configured in this repo.

## Architecture

### Routing & content
- Standard Next.js App Router under `src/app`. Each route that needs page-specific `<head>` metadata (title/OG tags) uses a co-located `layout.tsx` exporting a `metadata` object, with the actual page content in `page.tsx` — see any `src/app/projects/*/layout.tsx` for the pattern to copy when adding a new project page.
- Blog posts are MDX files in `src/content/blog/*.mdx` with frontmatter (title, description, date, coverImage, icon). `src/lib/mdx.ts` reads them from the filesystem with `gray-matter` and exposes `getPostBySlug` / `getAllPostsMeta`, both wrapped in React's `cache()`. `src/app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx` renders them via `next-mdx-remote/rsc`, computes reading time from word count, and renders comments through Giscus.
- `src/app/sitemap.ts` hardcodes the static route list and project slugs, then appends blog routes from `getAllPostsMeta()`. **When adding a new project or top-level route, update this file's `staticRoutes` array manually** — it is not auto-derived from the filesystem.
- Layout shell (`src/components/layout/layout-wrapper.tsx`, a client component) renders a collapsible desktop sidebar (`src/components/app-sidebar`) driven by `useSidebar()` (`src/hooks/use-sidebar.tsx`), a mobile header + bottom nav on small screens, and a persistent footer. Global overlays (`CommandMenu`, `ChatWidget`, Vercel `Analytics`) are mounted once in `src/app/layout.tsx` outside the themed layout tree.

### The AI chat widget
- `src/app/api/chat/route.ts` is an edge route using the Vercel AI SDK (`streamText`) against Groq (`llama-3.1-8b-instant`, falling back to `llama-3.3-70b-versatile` on error). It rate-limits by IP via Upstash Redis (`Ratelimit.slidingWindow(5, "1 m")`), rejects messages over 500 chars, and does a simple keyword blocklist check before calling the model.
- The system prompt is **not static** — `src/lib/ai-config.ts`'s `buildDynamicPrompt(userMessage)` fuzzy-matches (Levenshtein-based typo tolerance) the incoming message against topic keyword sets (projects, blog, contact, resume, hobbies, etc.) and concatenates only the matching prompt sections onto a base persona prompt. The persona is scripted to speak *as* Ian in first person, never admit to being an AI, and only reference facts/links explicitly written into this file.
- When asked to add/update project or blog descriptions the chatbot can discuss, edit the relevant section in `ai-config.ts` directly — descriptions and links are hardcoded per project/post, not derived from `src/content/blog` or a projects data file.

### External integrations (all server-side, keyed off env vars in `.env.local`)
- **Upstash Redis** (`src/lib/redis.ts`): shared client used for chat rate-limiting and blog view counts.
- **View counter**: `src/app/api/views/[slug]/route.ts` hashes `ip + slug` (SHA-256) to dedupe a visitor for 24h via `SETNX`, then increments a Redis counter; `src/components/ui/view-counter.tsx` reads it through `unstable_cache` (60s revalidate) and is rendered inside a `Suspense` boundary on the blog post page.
- **Spotify** (`src/lib/spotify.ts` + `src/app/api/spotify/route.ts`): refresh-token OAuth flow to fetch "now playing" for the spotify card component; fetch results are cached with `next: { revalidate: 30 }`.
- **WakaTime** (`src/lib/wakatime.ts`): fetches last-7-days coding stats, cached with `next: { revalidate: 60 }`; returns `null` on missing key or failed fetch rather than throwing.
- **Resend** (`src/app/actions/sendEmail.ts`): a `"use server"` action used by the contact form. Validates fields/email format, then sends two emails in parallel (a styled notification to the site owner with `replyTo` set to the sender, and an auto-reply confirmation to the sender) with inline HTML email templates.
- **Giscus**: comments on blog posts, configured entirely through `NEXT_PUBLIC_GISCUS_*` env vars.

### Env vars
Required in `.env.local` (see that file for the full list of names): `GROQ_API_KEY`, `GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY`, `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL`/`TOKEN`, `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID`/`SECRET`/`REFRESH_TOKEN`, `WAKATIME_API_KEY`, `RESEND_API_KEY`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SENDER_EMAIL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_RECEIVER_EMAIL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_GISCUS_*`.

### UI components
- `src/components/ui/` mixes shadcn/ui-generated primitives (button, dialog, sheet, sidebar, avatar, etc. — see `components.json` for the shadcn config: New York style, zinc base, RSC-enabled, path aliases `@/components`, `@/lib`, `@/hooks`) with bespoke portfolio components (spotify-card, wakatime-card, hover-video-card, animated-backgrounds, typewriter-effect, etc.). When adding shadcn primitives, follow the existing aliasing rather than hand-rolling equivalents.
- Path alias `@/*` maps to `./src/*` (see `tsconfig.json`).
